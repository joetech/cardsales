## Hardware

**Rollo Thermal Printers**

Stop cutting out mailing labels and taping them to packages. This thermal printer prints 4x6 labels fast that you can just peel and stick.

**Guillotine Paper Cutter**

It's a lot cheaper to print your own fliers and inserts 2 or 4 to a page and then cut them with a good paper cutter. I use this to prep 100 fliers at a time. It also works for cutting cardboard inserts.

**Card-Friendly Document Scanners**

Scanning cards rapidly is a big part of my bulk listing workflow. I personally use the older 7160 model, but the 8170 has some nice options that make it appealing.

## Supplies

**Thermal Shipping Labels**

I always have the stack in use and an extra box so I never run out.

**Graded Card Bags**

You can use blue painter's tape to keep cards from slipping out of toploaders, but I find these to work great and use at least 1 per order.

## Platforms

**Card Dealer Pro (CDP)**

![alt text](img/image-13.png)

I use CDP as my home base for bulk selling. From here, can upload 200+ or more images and let its AI automations do much of the work, saving me from having to type in each card title and details. Their pricing tools are not perfect, but they're pretty good and also save me time. Once a batch is ready, I can list to eBay or CollX with one click (also WhatNot or Shopify if I used either) and I can export a CSV to list anywhere else I can batch import (like District). Plans start at $9/month (500 AI scans) and go up depending on how many scans you need.

**District**

District is a fast-growing platform built by and for collectors with the ability to list BIN, auctions, or host live stream selling events. Their import works well for listing large batches quickly and scripts in this repository help streamline that process.

**eBay**

eBay really doesn't need an introduction. It's been around for decades and drives the most passive sales of the platforms I use.

**CollX**

![alt text](img/image-10.png)

I'm a desktop guy, so CollX is harder for me to adjust to and I have to email each shipping label to myself so I can print it from my desktop since my Rollo is not networked. That said, it's integrated with CDP (listed above), so sending a batch to it is a one-click process. They also have integrated labels, so I don't worry about how much shipping costs as their platform just handles all that.
